// ==== Callbacks ====

/* Step 1: Create a higher-order function
 * Create a higher-order function named consume with 3 parameters: a, b and cb
 * The first two parameters can take any argument (we can pass any value as argument)
 * The last parameter accepts a callback
 * The consume function should return the invocation of cb, passing a and b into cb as arguments
 */

const consume = (a, b, cb) => cb(a, b);

/* Step 2: Create several functions to callback with consume();
 * Create a function named add that returns the sum of two numbers
 * Create a function named multiply that returns the product of two numbers
 * Create a function named greeting that accepts a first and last name and returns "Hello first-name last-name, nice to meet you!"
 */

const add = (a, b) => a + b;
const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;
const greeting = (first, last) => `Hello ${first} ${last}, nice to meet you!`;

/* Step 3: Check your work by un-commenting the following calls to consume(): */
console.log(consume(2, 2, add)); // 4
console.log(consume(10, 16, multiply)); // 160
console.log(consume("Mary", "Poppins", greeting)); // Hello Mary Poppins, nice to meet you!

// ==== Closures ====

// Explain in your own words why nestedfunction can access the variable internal.

/* Explanation: When functions cannot find a variable in their scope, 
they go outer scope to look for it. It goes like that all the way to the global scope until
the function finds the variable. However, they cannot go up and down and look inside 
other function's scope that are in the same level with them.
*/

const external = "I'm outside the function";

function myFunction() {
  console.log(external);
  const internal = "Hello! I'm inside myFunction!";

  function nestedFunction() {
    console.log(internal);
  }
  nestedFunction();
}
myFunction();
